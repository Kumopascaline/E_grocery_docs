  ONLINE GROCERY SHOPPING SYSTEM
  (E-GROCERY) 

    Introduction
    
Customers may buy groceries and other household supplies online from the convenience of their homes using an e-grocery system. A typical component of this kind of system is an online store or mobile app that sells a variety of goods, such as groceries, home goods, and fresh produce. A number of payment options are accepted when customers browse the available products, add items to their virtual shopping carts, and finish their purchases online. Additionally, e-grocery systems could offer alternatives for curbside pickup or home delivery in addition to order tracking and customer support services. These technologies are intended to make grocery shopping for customers quick and easy, but simultaneously minimizing face-to-face encounters and encouraging social seclusion.

  Purposes of the app
	The major goals of on-line grocery are:
The creation and development of new models.
-On-line grocery shopping can increase the productivity of an on-line grocery merchant by providing "just in time" service, cutting down on overhead costs, and shortening supply chains.
-Save the user's time and effort. 
-Save time and effort compared to driving a car or taking public transportation like a jeep. 
-Unlike conventional markets, where you must wait in line at the checkout counter to load all of your products, on-line grocery shopping allows you to sit back, relax, and search for the product. In order to make grocery shopping easier for consumers, the proponents suggested an on-line system.

  App Architecture

The App was build using Fluter using the Dart language with clean Architecture.




By dividing the Educmr app into these three layers,  the code is organized in a clean and easily scalable way. Each layer has a specific responsibility and can be developed and tested separately from the others. This makes it easier to maintain and modify the app over time.
